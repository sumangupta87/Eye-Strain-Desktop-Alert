# Overview

Screen time is a big issue these days. You probably spend a good number of hours looking at screens, like your computer at work and at home, your smartphone, 
television, or other digital devices. Looking at screens too much can lead to eye strain. But the 20-20-20 rule may help.

# What’s the 20-20-20 rule?
If you find yourself gazing at screens all day, your eye doctor may have mentioned this rule to you. Basically, every 20 minutes spent using a screen, 
you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.

# Why 20 seconds?
It takes about 20 seconds for your eyes to completely relax.

# How can you tell if something is 20 feet away?
Unless you have a tape measure you probably won’t be able to accurately measure 20 feet. Being exact isn’t the key. You should just try to focus on something far away from you. 
Consider looking out a window at an object that seems far away, like a tree or a building across the street.

# What about reminding yourself to do this every 20 minutes?
To remind your self every 20 min use the attached "EyeStrain.py" script.

# What are the symptoms of eye strain?
Having sore, tired, burning, or itching eyes are the main symptoms of eye strain.

Other symptoms include:

dry eyes
watery eyes
blurred vision
doubled vision
headaches
soreness in the neck, shoulders, or back
sensitivity to light
trouble concentrating
difficulty keeping eyes open
